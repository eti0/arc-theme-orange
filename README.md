# Arc Theme Orange
An Orange-themed derivation of [Horst3180's Arc Theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme).

This version is developed in my free time so if you want to help don't hesitate and commit your modifications to the repository.

You can download the theme built [here](https://github.com/eti0/arc-theme-orange/releases/download/1.2/arc-orange-theme.zip).

Arc is a flat theme with transparent elements for GTK 3, GTK 2 and Gnome-Shell which supports GTK 3 and GTK 2 based desktop environments like Gnome, Unity, Budgie, Pantheon, XFCE, Mate, etc.

#### Manual Installation

**Important:** Remove all older versions of the theme from your system before you proceed any further.

    sudo rm -rf /usr/share/themes/{Arc-Orange,Arc-Orange-Darker,Arc-Orange-Dark}
    rm -rf ~/.local/share/themes/{Arc-Orange,Arc-Orange-Darker,Arc-Orange-Dark}
    rm -rf ~/.themes/{Arc-Orange,Arc-Orange-Darker,Arc-Orange-Dark}

To build the theme you'll need
* `autoconf`

* `pkg-config` or `pkgconfig` if you use Fedora
* `libgtk-3-dev` for Debian based distros or `gtk3-devel` for RPM based distros
* `git` if you want to clone the source directory

If your distributions doesn't ship separate development packages you just need GTK 3 instead of the `-dev` packages.

### Troubleshooting

If you have Ubuntu with a newer GTK/Gnome version than the one included by default (i.e Ubuntu 14.04 with GTK 3.14 or Ubuntu 15.04 with GTK 3.16, etc.) the prebuilt packages won't work properly and you have to install the theme manually as described above.
This is also true for other distros with a different GTK/Gnome version than the one included by default

--

If you get artifacts like black or invisible backgrounds under Unity, disable overlay scrollbars with

    gsettings set com.canonical.desktop.interface scrollbar-mode normal
